 * This program lets the user play rock paper scissors against the 
 * computer. The game is played in rounds and will prompt the player to
 * pick rock, paper, or scissors (case insensitive) at which point the
 * computer will pick a random option (rock, paper, or scissors) and
 * will tell the player who won the round. The program will run as long
 * as the player wants with the option to quit after each round
 * Additionally, the program will keep track of the total scores of the
 * player and the computer as well as the current round number. The
 * game will only run on the console, but it may be given a GUI in the
 * future.
